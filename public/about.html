<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Cass Moore. I have a dog named Sienna, who I spend lots of time with playing outside and taking on many walks. I currently am learning web development and this is one of my first projects. In my spare time I enjoy reading and am an avid film fan. I also enjoy televsion shows like Doctor Who and The Sopranos. One of my favorite daily hobbies is cooking one nice, complex meal a day with my partner, we both enjoy the process and love eating a tasty meal as the end result. Some of my favorite sports teams are the New York Mets, Jets, Syracuse basketball and Liverpool FC.</p>


<p>There is a lot more about me but this is where I will wrap it up and hopefully we can get to know each other better soon!</p>
